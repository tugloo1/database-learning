-- Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Products table:

-- The list_price column
-- The discount_percent column
-- A column named discount_amount that uses the previous two columns to calculate the discount amount and 
-- uses the ROUND function to round the result so it has 2 decimal digits
-- Sort the result set by the discount_amount column in ascending sequence.

SELECT
	list_price,
    discount_percent,
    ROUND((list_price * discount_percent/100), 2) AS discount_amount
FROM
	my_guitar_shop.products

ORDER By discount_amount ASC;

-- Use a correlated subquery to return one row per customer, representing the customerâ€™s oldest order (the one with the earliest date). 
-- Each row should include these three columns: email_address, oldest_order_id, and oldest_order_date. 
-- Only include customers who have placed an order.
-- Sort the result set by the oldest_order_date and oldest_order_id columns.

-- Write a SELECT statement that returns three columns: email_address, order_id, and the order total for each customer. 
-- To do this, you can group the result set by the email_address and order_id columns. 
-- In addition, you must calculate the order total from the columns in the Order_Items table.

-- Write a second SELECT statement that uses the first SELECT statement in its FROM clause. 
-- The main query should return three columns: the customerâ€™s email address and the largest order (aliased as max_order_total) 
-- and the smallest order_id (aliased as min_order_id). To do this, you can group the result set by the email_address. 
-- Sort the result set by the largest order in descending sequence.

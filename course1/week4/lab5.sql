-- Use the UNION operator to generate a result set consisting of three columns from the Orders table: 
-- 
-- 
-- 
-- ship_status A calculated column that contains a value of SHIPPED or NOT SHIPPED
-- 
-- order_id The order_id column
-- 
-- order_date The order_date column
-- 
-- 
-- If the order has a value in the ship_date column, the ship_status column should contain a value of SHIPPED. Otherwise, it should contain a value of NOT SHIPPED.
-- Sort the final result set by the order_date column.

		'SHIPPED' as ship_status, order_id, order_date
